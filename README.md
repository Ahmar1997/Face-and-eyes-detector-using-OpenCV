# Face-and-eyes-detector-using-OpenCV


This is a simple face and eye detection program built using OpenCV library. It uses Haar Cascade Classifiers to detect the presence of faces and eyes in an image. The program captures video from your webcam or can detect faces and eyes from a specified image, and displays the detected faces in a rectangular box with green color and eyes in rectangular boxes with blue color. The program is built using Python and requires OpenCV and NumPy libraries.
