# Face-and-eyes-detector-using-OpenCV


This is a simple face and eye detection program built using OpenCV library. It uses Haar Cascade Classifiers to detect the presence of faces and eyes in an image. The program captures video from your webcam or can detect faces and eyes from a specified image, and displays the detected faces and eyes in a rectangular box with green color. The program is built using Python and requires OpenCV and NumPy libraries. Contributions to the project are always welcome!
